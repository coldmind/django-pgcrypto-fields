# django-pgcrypto-fields [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coldmind/django-pgcrypto-fields.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/coldmind/django-pgcrypto-fields?branch=master)

`django-pgcrypto-fields` is a `Django` extension which relies upon `pgcrypto` to
encrypt and decrypt data for fields.

Forked due to porting to python 2.
Added some additional PGP fields and removed all fields
except PGP public ones.
